Methylation Toolkit
====

This folder contains a suite of tools used to analyze methylation data. Some of the tools have been recently wrapped, with the help of new galaxy data abstractions like "dataset collections".

Other tools have been adapted from community contributions.

### Testing

To test the tools individually, you can install "planemo". You can follow the installation instructions at http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html .

Once you have planemo installed, you can try the following statements to run the tool and test.
I suggest using planemo serve for this, https://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands/serve.html?highlight=serve (Thanks to @jmchilton)

```
## Planemo serve
planemo s bumphunter.xml
```
